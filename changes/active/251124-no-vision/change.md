# Change: Implement action should handle vision.md and design.md specially

## Problem

- vision.md needs to be generated and reviewed but it is just a few lines

## Solution

- vision.md won't be a part of the specs anymore
- instead for the specs we will use requirements.md
- Unified [psa-structure.md](../../../.seeai/rules/psa-structure.md) will be used for change.md and requirements.md
- All specs will use requirements.md
