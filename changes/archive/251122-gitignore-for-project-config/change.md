# Change: Add .gitignore modifications to analysis.md for project-level configuration

## Why

When project-level configuration happens during SeeAI installation or setup, temporary or generated files may be created that should not be committed to version control, leading to repository clutter.

## How

Modify the analyze.md Action to include a specific section or reminder about updating .gitignore file when project-level configuration changes are detected, ensuring unnecessary files are prevented from being committed.
