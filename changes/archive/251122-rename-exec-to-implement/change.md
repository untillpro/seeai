# Change: Rename exec.md action to implement.md

## Why

The name "exec" is too generic and doesn't clearly convey that the action is about implementing specifications or todo items.

## How

Rename the file from exec.md to implement.md and update all references to this action throughout the project, including triggering instructions in agents.md.
