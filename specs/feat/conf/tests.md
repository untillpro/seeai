# Test: SeeAI Configuration Script

## Overview

- Black box testing strategy for [scripts/seeai.sh](../../../scripts/seeai.sh) using BATS (Bash Automated Testing System). Tests execute the script as a whole without accessing internal functions.
- [Initial version](https://github.com/untillpro/seeai/blob/3531723c2238c184ef425ac3f0f6004d90b057eb/specs/feat/conf/test.md)

## Testing Approach

Black Box Testing:

- Execute the script as an external command
- Test only through public interface (command line arguments, stdin, stdout, stderr, exit codes)
- No access to internal functions or variables
- Validate behavior through observable outputs and side effects

## Test Environment Strategy

### Isolated Test Environment

Each test runs in isolated environment:

- Temporary directory for all file operations
- Create necessary directory structure in temp dir
- Mocks
  - Controlled environment variables (HOME, APPDATA)
  - Simulated user input via stdin
  - GitHub API: Mock curl command with stub responses
  - Git operations: Mock git command for local mode tests only
- Execute script as external command (no sourcing)
- Cleanup all resources after test completes
