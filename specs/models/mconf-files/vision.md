# Model: Installation File Structure

## Why

We need formal documentation of installation file structure patterns to provide a single source of truth for where SeeAI files are installed across different agents (Augment, Claude, Copilot) and scopes (User Scope, Project Scope), including OS-specific variations and file transformation rules.

## What

Installation file structure model that defines:

- Base directory patterns for each agent
- Subdirectory usage rules
- OS-specific path variations for Copilot user scope
- File transformation rules (naming, extensions, path flattening)
- Version file location rules
- File categories and scope distribution
- Agents Config File selection rules
