## Why

- spec-kit and bmad
  - Appears to over-specify
  - Introduces new conceptions (Constitution, BMAD method)
  - Complex workflow, internal tracking status
  - Artifacts are installed per repo
- bmad
  - Requires node
- spec-kit
  - Requires uv tool
  - ps scripts
  - Does not work for a project that is not in a repo root
